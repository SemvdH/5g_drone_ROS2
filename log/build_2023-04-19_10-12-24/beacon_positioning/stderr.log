CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbeacon_positioning.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "beacon_positioning", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "beacon_positioning" with any of the following names:

    beacon_positioningConfig.cmake
    beacon_positioning-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "beacon_positioning" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "beacon_positioning_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "beacon_positioning" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
